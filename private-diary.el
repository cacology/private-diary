;;; Commentary:
;; This package supports a private diary file that functions like the
;; existing Emacs diary, but can be encrypted while leaving the
;; non-private diary in plain text. Documentation on
;; https://github.com/cacology/private-diary

;;; Code:

(require 'diary-lib)

(defgroup private-diary nil
  "Variables for the private-diary package."
  :prefix "private-diary"
  :group 'tools
  :link '(url-link :tag "Github" "https://github.com/cacology/private-diary")
  )

(defcustom private-diary-file "~/private-diary.txt.gpg"
  "The file that is the other diary, not currently in use."
  :group 'private-diary
  :type '(file))

(defun swap-diary-and-private-diary nil
  "Swaps the values of the diary-file and private-diary-file."
  (interactive nil)
  (let ((old-diary-file diary-file))
    (setq diary-file private-diary-file)
    (setq private-diary-file old-diary-file)
    (message "Diary: %s Private: %s" diary-file private-diary-file)))
